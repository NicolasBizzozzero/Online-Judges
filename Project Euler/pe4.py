# This program find the solution of the problem 4 of the Project Euler.
# The problem is the following :
#
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
#
# The answer to this problem is :
# 906609
