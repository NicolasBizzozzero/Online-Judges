;; Clojure's for macro is a tremendously versatile mechanism for producing a sequence based on some other sequence(s). It can take some time to understand how to use it properly, but that investment will be paid back with clear, concise sequence-wrangling later. With that in mind, read over these for expressions and try to see how each of them produces the same result.

;; (= __ (for [x (range 40)
;;            :when (= 1 (rem x 4))]
;;        x))

;; (= __ (for [x (iterate #(+ 4 %) 0)
;;            :let [z (inc x)]
;;            :while (< z 40)]
;;        z))

;; (= __ (for [[x y] (partition 2 (range 20))]
;;        (+ x y)))
